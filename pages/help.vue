        <h2>Search Tips</h2>

        <p><strong>The standard primary street address includes (with example):</strong></p>

        <ul>
          <li>Street Number (401)</li>
          <li>Pre Directional (N)</li>
          <li>Street Name (Morton)</li>
          <li>Street Name Type Suffix (Street)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>It is not necessary to enter an apartment or suite number.</p>

        <p>Do not enter the postal community, state or zip code.</p>

        <p>The address search is not case sensitive, that is you can use upper or lowercase when entering text. For example, 401 n morton street works as well as 401 N Morton Street or 401 N MORTON STREET.</p>

        <p>You may abbreviate the street direction using the first letter of the direction, such as n for north. (401 N Morton Street) If you are unsure of the street direction, you may leave it off. (401 Morton Street) If there is more than one match, you will be provided with a list of address choices.</p>

        <p>You may abbreviate the street type suffix with a postal standard abbreviation. If you are unsure of the correct suffix or not finding the address you are searching for, try leaving it off. (401 N Morton) If there is more than one match, you will be provided with a list of address choices.</p>

        <p>The numbered streets in Bloomington are entered as numbers and not spelled out. These include 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th, 13th, 14th, 15th, 16th, 17th, 18th, 19th, 20th.</p>

        <p>Enter state road addresses in the form of street number, street direction State Road, and state road number. For example, 4125 E State Road 45. The correct street name form for addresses on the Bypass is State Road 45 46 Bypass. Addresses on the Bypass that are south of E 10th Street/E State Road 45, are N or S State Road 46 addresses.</p>

        <p>There are a few Bloomington streets  that also includes a post direction after the street name type suffix.</p>

        <p><strong>These include:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>E Bayberry Court E and E Bayberry Court W</li>
          <li>N Glenwood Avenue E and N Glenwood Ave W</li>
          <li>E Longwood Court E and E Longwood Court W</li>
